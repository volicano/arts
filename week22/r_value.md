## 你有什么价值?

I love binge-watching *Shark Tank.*  I am endlessly fascinated by the lengths people will go to in the quest for entrepreneurship. These people risk their homes, their finances, their relationships, and their sanity for a desire to own something for themselves.

Since I have zero desire to be an entrepreneur, mostly because marketing scares me, I live vicariously through the intrepid entrepreneurs that walk the plank into the Shark Tank. I watch their stories unfold as they pitch their products and services to gain a chance to supercharge their businesses with the help of well-connected millionaires and billionaires. The American Dream.

On an episode last season, one of the self-made millionaire Sharks, Robert Herjavec, said something that struck me. He remarked that business only cares about the value you add. So I looked it up, and I found this quote:

>*“Remember that people at their core really don’t care about your background. They don’t care about your color. They don’t really care about your religion or your sex. They just care how much value you’re going to add.” — *[Robert Herjavec](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/278061)

And that last statement stuck with me. People only care about the value you that you add. They care about little else. In business and in relationships, people are concerned with what you have to offer.

I began to wonder. What value do I add? In writing, teaching, parenting, relationships, do I add value in every area of my life?

I began to wonder why have I never considered that adding value should be my focus. As a Type-A, goal-oriented person who marches from one task to the next, I wondered why I never stopped to consider the value I am adding to those around me.

So, I googled “why adding value is important,” and an endless supply of links to business and personal development websites appeared. Apparently, adding value is a thing. So well-known that self-help gurus and wealthy businessmen discuss it in detailed blog posts and how-to guides.

I always thought the [most important part of being a good leader ](https://theascent.pub/how-to-be-a-decent-human-being-advice-for-leaders-8ea53c370471)was valuing others. Valuing what others contribute and learning to recognize others consistently and with care.

And I still feel that valuing others is integral to successful businesses and organizations. But perhaps I have been too focused on **wanting to feel valued**that I am failing to see the big picture.

Maybe I should be striving to add value without the need for recognition. ***Maybe I should be striving to add value because it’s the right thing to do.***

>*Because what you add to this world is more important than what you get out of it.*


Whether it’s to my readers, my students, my children, or my family, I want to add value. I want to feel as if I left a piece of me with each person I have met. I want to feel as if what I offer adds value to someone else’s life.

And that’s no easy quest. Do my words resonate with my readers? Do my lessons resonate with my students? Do the people around me feel that I have added something to their lives?


大意：

*请记住，核心人员真的不关心你的背景。他们不关心你的肤色。他们并不真正关心你的宗教信仰或性别。他们只关心你要添加多少价值。*
