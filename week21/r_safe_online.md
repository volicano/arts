• **A continuous conversation.** It’s never too early to start talking to your child about how to make the best of the online world, how to stay safe, and what to do if they ever feel uncomfortable. Conversations should ideally start as soon as your child is old enough to search the internet or use YouTube, and you can revisit these chats as often as needed. Lecturing or tying to instil fear rarely works- children are more likely to respond to a conversation when you are curious about what they think.

With older children, who may be embarrassed or reluctant to discuss issues such as ‘sexting’ or sending of ‘nude selfies’ with you, you could use something you’re watching on TV or a film, images on a billboard glimpsed during a car journey, or a story in the news to kick-start a casual chat about sexuality.

• **Keep an eye on the computer.** If possible, locate the computer your child uses in a central area of the home where you can keep a discreet eye on what they are doing. Familiarize yourself with privacy settings and parental controls — while remaining mindful of children’s frequent aptitude for unlocking security systems and guessing passwords.

• **Create a family** **technology contract.** Jointly come up with a set of agreements on the boundaries that the whole family will apply to their use of devices. The contract may cover; amount of time spent on screens; a ‘switch off’ time for devices in evening; dedicated ‘digital detox’ periods when everyone agrees to take a break from devices; no scrolling through phones at mealtimes; possible consequences if the contract is not respected.

• **Importance of gaining consent.** Discuss with your child the importance of gaining consent before sharing a photo or video of someone else online and vice versa. Talk though the challenges that can arise in these situations and how your child thinks they may handle this? For example, it can be extremely hard for a young person to say no to a friend or family member even if they have asked permission. Emphasise that if they are ever worried about something begin shared involving them that they don’t want online, then it is important that they speak to you or an adult that they trust.

• **Help them learn to think before they post.** Remind them that posting online is instant, public and forms a permanent ‘digital tattoo.’ It’s important for them to learn to be self aware and savvy and develop a good digital footprint. Encourage your child to think about why they are posting, whether they would say this in person (if it’s a ‘no’ then they should not be putting this online), if it could be misinterpreted, are they being kind and is it legal. Also discuss how posting when they are in an emotionally reactive state, such as angry or upset is never a good idea as they cannot be rational or think through potential consequences.

• **Monitor your own reactions.** Whatever difficulties your child may get involved with in the online world e.g., deliberately perusing porn online, a victim of cyberbullying, or bullying others, as a parent, the most important thing is to monitor your own reaction before responding. However shocked, angry, disappointed or upset you feel, the best thing you can do for your child is to remain calm and work with them to agree the best course of action.

• **Seek solutions together.** Use any online difficulties as opportunities to help your child develop their own problem-solving skills. It’s also worth remembering that in the online world the distinction between victim and perpetrator can easily blur. Children who engage in cyber-bullying may once have been victims themselves, and vice-versa. It’s often best to resist the impulse to confront culprits or their parents immediately and instead work with your child on how to respond.

• **Keep screenshots, save nasty messages and seek professional help.** If your child is being subjected to consistent abuse or threats online it may be wise to consult school authorities or the police. Keep screenshots of offensive material, save nasty messages and bear in mind that in some cases cyber-bullying can be a crime.

• **Emphasize the positives.** Young people love the online world and sharing content and engaging with content shared by others. It can help to inspire new interests, share support for a campaign, raise awareness of important issues and make new friends. They will respond if you show an interest in the positive aspects of their experience. So ask your child about the connections they make with friends, the new perspectives they gain on issues, the interests they pursue and the games they play.

•  **Find your tribe.** Remember that every parent is learning how to oversee their youngsters’ digital lives so you are not alone. Team up with friends who share a similar attitude to the online world so that you can support each other’s efforts to set appropriate limits and exchange ideas on what works.
